body_positive,This #TeacherAppreciationWeek  we re honoring #MaryMeachum Her incredible story is an inspiration and a reminder of how far so many teachers go for their students and communities. We appreciate you and your hard work and big hearts so much!  Never stop fighting.   In 1815  Meachum’s  owner  took her to St. Louis  Missouri. Her husband followed and purchased her freedom shortly afterward. The Meachums ran a school for free and enslaved black people in the First African Baptist Church  which they later moved to a floating steamboat on the Mississippi River when the state of Missouri banned education for blacks in 1847. After the death of her husband in 1854  Meachum continued running their home on Fourth Street as a ‘safe house’ on the Underground Railroad. On May 21  1855  after an attempt to ferry nine enslaved people across the Mississippi River to freedom in Illinois  Meachum and a freedman named Isaac were arrested for breaking the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. On May 24  1854  she was charged in court with slave theft  while charges against Isaac were dropped.   https://blackthen.com/mary-meachum-abolitionist-helped-enslaved-escape-freedom/

body_positive,[Body Shaming ANY Body Is Bad For Everybody]  Body shaming isn t reserved for one body type.   Fit  women are  obsessed.   Fat  women are  lazy.   Skinny  women need to  eat a sandwich.   Muscular  women are  manly.   Curvy  women are  real women.   No one is immune to these labels and judgments as long as we continue to accept society s view that the value of a woman is in her decoration.  It s time we put an end to these labels and judgments.   To live in a world where women are regarded as people and not decoration  we need to stop making comments on other women’s appearance as though it is our right to do so. We’ll be doing each other a favor.  - Erin Brown  Further  while it s crucial to recognize that while body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  it s important to note that the impact/outcome/experiences of thin or straight-sized women cannot be conflated with those of women in larger bodies.  Anti-fatness  fat bias  and fat stigma are incredibly important issues that cannot be ignored as they affect the mental  physical  and emotional well-being of so many folks  from medical concerns being brushed off or incorrectly attributed to body size  to not being able to find clothes that fit  to consistent harassment  discrimination  and abuse related to body size.  While body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  the experiences and outcomes are absolutely not the same.
body_positive,I JUST NEED YOU TO TELL ME THAT IT SUCKS.  I spent FIVE hours in the dentist chair yesterday.  On my way home I was hungry  thirsty  and most of all -- CRANKY.  I walked in my house  dramatically flinging the door open for effect and -- BAM!  I smacked right into it.  Something was blocking the door so I couldn t fully open it. One of my biggest pet peeves.  UGH.  The story I told myself was Casey Sasek didn t care about me enough to make sure nothing was blocking the door when I got home  and worse -- he probably KNEW it was blocking the door and *really* didn t care.  I mean -- he KNEW I was on my way home.  It s clearly HIS fault I m so cranky.  I was ready to start a fight.  Then I stopped  took a deep breath  and asked myself:  Is this true or is it a story I m telling myself?  Do I really want to start a fight?  What s going on? What do I need right now?  It hit me.  All I needed was for him to recognize my crankiness and validate me.  Of course I m cranky. I spent five hours at the dentist. That sucks. Anyone would be cranky.  I walked into the room and pouted:  “I m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.   He got up  walked over  wrapped his arms tightly around me and said   “I m sorry  babe. That DOES suck. It sounds awful.   Instantly my whole body relaxed.  That was all I needed (plus some coffee and food!)  Later I wondered -- how different could things be if we actually ASKED for what we need?  Instead of blowing it up  starting a fight  lashing out  making our problem their problem.  What if we just asked for what we need in the moment?  I need attention. I need validation. I need you to tell me that it s going to be OK. I need you to tell me that I m going to be OK. I need you to be angry at what I m angry at. I need you to see me. I need you to hear me. I need you to love me.  Yes  this is easier said than done.  And I don t always know what I need in the moment  and that s OK.  But I ve found it gets better with practice.  When I m able to stop  get silent  and tune in -- allowing myself to be vulnerable enough to ask for what I need -- it s always a game-changer. : Beaux Arts Photographie

(There are two options for your arms  the second being the more  secure  option  but choose whichever is more comfortable)   You can play around with your foot position  but you ll likely need to be about shoulder-width apart or wider for your comfort  then you ll hinge back into your hips  and grab the band between your feet.

clean_eating,Posted @withrepost • @bodyimage_therapist Usually  the word  judgement  brings to mind something negative. However  judgements are judgements. There may be more acceptable judgements  or more taboo judgements. For example  it s more acceptable to say  oh wow you ve lost weight  good job!  and more taboo to say  you ve gained weight  what happened? . Just because one is more socially acceptable  doesn t mean the praised-based  positive judgement  serves the person. Whether it be praising or scolding  judgements create a hierarchical interaction. It is implied that the person doing the judging has more ability than the person being judged. If a person thrives off praise  praise will always be based on the values system of the person dishing it out. . . If you ve noticed someone s weight change - it is not your task to pass judgement on that - positive or negative. If you thrive off people commenting positively on your body  especially after weight or body related change  what are you really seeking from them? . . I understand this is a topic of debate.

Posted @withrepost • @themshealth A 2017 report from @apapsychiatric reported that “LGBTQ individuals are more than twice as likely as heterosexual men and women to have a mental health disorder in their lifetime ” and that  “LGBTQ individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience depression  anxiety  and substance misuse compared with heterosexual individuals.” For community members this likely comes as no shock. But what the @apapsychiatric report goes on to clarify  and what is immensely helpful  is some of the underlying reason WHY this is the case. Put simply  “Health disparities among LGBTQ people are linked to stigma and discrimination.” Meaning: feeling safe accessing healthcare services  lack of social support  familial rejection  higher rates of poverty and unemployment (among trans people in particular)  and violence are all factors leading to the more fragile state of LGBTQ mental health.  While this study is wildly helpful and affirming in its callout of these causes for mental health distress  it also implies the need for future research to understand the non-binary population for a more nuanced picture of the LGBTQ community as it evolves  particularly with the growing number of youth identifying as non-binary.  And so we (especially straight/cis allies  and people of privilege within the LGBTQ community) should be asking ourselves: how do we create a more inclusive world for people of all genders and sexualities?

The fat liberation story almost always goes like this—the visibility of fat & free women  witnessed by the fat and still fatphobic. It gives your brain this understanding of -oh- what if I didn’t focus my life on changing my body into something it has never been? What if I just...lived my life? Could I be happy like these women so clearly are? Could I stop weight cycling? Could I disengage from the agreement that there’s something inherently wrong or bad or immoral about my body?  They taught me how fat could be cool—how historically  the marginalized groups  the outsiders  the early adopters  those outside the normative  ahead of the mainstream: they are always the driving force of cool  of art  of punk  of fashion  of innovation. Seeing women who were both fatter and cooler than me  modeling freedom  fundamentally changed my brain.  So when there are days where you feel like you can’t do it for yourself - do it for those around you. . . #thebodyisnotanapology #tbinaa #radicalselflove #10toolsintensive . .

clean_eating,Posted @withrepost • @tomvslopez ITS PRIDE MONTH!! I understand the importance of helping two spirit people reclaim their power. Two spirit people have always played important roles in our tribes. We each had our own names for what we called these people but they were always treated with respect. We want the world to know we exist  we will no longer live in dark closets and corners. We step forward and accept the love we deserve. Happy pride month family  be yourself  love yourself and take care of your temple (your body.) Pride Month isn’t just about partying  it’s about celebrating the duality and freedom each and every one of us possesses and the journey we took to get here. #TwoSpiritPride . . .

clean_eating, Posted @withrepost • @tlynnfaz (longish post. mostly for black folks.) let black men be soft.  particularly straight cis black men  question why the word  soft  is a pejorative to them. to allow themselves to put down the hard perception of masculinity that they feel they have to uphold. to allow themselves to be soft  to be light  to be tender  to be gentle  to feel. so that they can be full expressions of their human selves. it s to expand the definitions of what masculinity and manhood are  so that all of us black women  femmes  trans and cis  gay men  and those rejecting or flowing fluidly throughout gender  do not have to deal with the harmful affects of what this white supremacist society has taught or forced yall to be. . . in my conversation with Trevor  who is drawn here  he mentioned being perceived as aggressive  and being denied his softer side. this piece is also directed to white people and non-black people who perceive black men as aggressive or as a threat because of their blackness. let them be soft. . . an older black man talked to me on the street about the piece soon after i finished putting it up. he wasn t happy. called it terrible for black men. his homophobia jumped out real quick. he took issue with the word soft. he took issue with there being flowers positioned next to the man s face. i admit that i started to doubt my work. i m not above questioning and changing my work  especially work that is placed outdoors  because i feel a sensitivity to the surrounding community. but this piece is part of a larger project on anti-blackness and sexual harassment. and any person who denies the humanity of black people in anyway  is perpetrating anti-blackness. including this older man. if cis-hetero black men interrogated the ways their manhood can be harmful  and the reasons they hold onto those harmful ideas of masculinity (is it out of necessity? survival? says who?)  maybe it would lead to them being gentler with themselves and thereby the women and queer people that are right next to them. . .

clean_eating, Art by @ashlukadraws  Posted @withrepost • @themshealth Your sexuality  your rules! We wanted to revisit some words from @thebodyisnotanapology around three keys to having good sex with non-binary people (even if it’s with yourself!): 1. Unlearn the binary scripts of sex: Your “gender identity is not necessarily directly correlated with what [you] like in bed  and [your] sexual experiences do not need to be informed by the gender binary.” 2. Recognize dysphoria: “The sounds you make  the expectations of what your body should do or should experience  the way you move – all this has been gendered  and whether you are nonbinary or being intimate with someone who is  it’s a process of consciously detaching those reductive gender ideas from what’s actually happening.  3. Focus on the realities of you and your bodies: “Remember that there’s no should here  nothing should necessarily feel good  just focus on what is...this is your body  and you are in control of what you do with it and what you want others to do with you. You define what feels pleasurable to you.

clean_eating,Friends  we wanted to share with you a poem that one of our readers  Jessica Bombra  wrote after being inspired by our founder Sonya Renee Taylor s book The Body Is Not An Apology. She wanted us to share both her poem (her first ever! We are so honored) and the backstory behind it. We hope it resonates with you as you pursue your own journeys of radical self-love and healing! <3  (Content note: includes references to abuse  including childhood sexual abuse)   This Body of Mine...  By Jessica Bombra  This body of mine   Full of scars & imperfections.  It has felt pleasure. It has has felt pain. It has been loved. It has been abused. It has birthed children. It has nurtured. It has given pleasure. It has loved. It has comforted the dying. It has embraced in joy. It has mourned. It has celebrated.  It is perfectly imperfect   This body of mine.  --  Jessica s backstory:   I stumbled upon your book this summer in the airport in Omaha  NE of all places. I immediately picked it up  purchased it and read it. I just knew I had to. This past summer so many things happened in my life  I came to several realizations and this book played a huge role in those realizations. I grew up mostly in a single parent home with an addict mom (mostly alcohol but some drugs also)  had an addict father and step-father  had been molested as a small child and raped as a teen. I questioned my sexual identity for ages. Then grew up and chose men who have tried to change me and tell me I would be good if only...There’s always been something about me  about my body that wasn’t good enough for them. I started believing that at an early age. I’m nearly 50 now and am in a marriage that isn’t so great but I’m working on changing that. I’m working on taking care of myself and my children. I’m working on accepting and loving myself and taking charge of me. I’m also finally able to say  without doubt  that I identify as pan-sexual. I’m embracing my sexuality and becoming comfortable with who I am. So. Thank you. I’m so glad that I discovered your book. I’m so glad I discovered you.   Thank you so much  Jessica. <3

Posted @withrepost • @evyan.whitney #ad I’m so excited to be partnering with @un_blush which is raising awareness and smashing the stigma of HSDD (hypoactive sexual desire disorder). My own sexuality has gone through the ebbs and flows of different levels of desire and I’m so glad that more folks are shining a light on this important issue that effects so many of us.  The #unblush event in NYC was incredible  sensual  and so affirming.

clean_eating,This tender long read provides healing wisdom into coping with some of the most challenging situations life throws at us  from painful breakups to family medical crises and mental health struggles. Whatever you’re going through  you’re not alone. And sometimes  sitting with your grief is the way through   “I laughed  and it wasn’t a moment when I thought  ‘Everything is going to be okay.’ Because everything is never okay. But it was a moment when I didn’t have to push the pain out of my eyes to see. Maybe because I was no longer trying to wrestle my pain to the ground or outrun it.”  [image description: Photograph of a woman whose back is to the camera.

clean_eating,In honor of Mothers’ Day yesterday  we present to you the story of a mother who taught her daughter radical self-love and made an everlasting impact  “Was it exciting for you to be able to put into this child an acceptance  a love even  of her body? Because while at the time it was normal for me  I see now  39 years later what a gift it was. Now that there are three generations of dwarf women in our family  I like to think that our bodies are our birthright.”  [image description: Close-up of a parent’s hand holding the hand of their baby.

clean_eating,Have you seen our latest newsletter? If not  there’s a link on our Facebook page. To give you just a little taste: . . “As Black lesbian womanist writer  poet  and activist Audre Lorde writes in ‘The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power’: ‘We have been raised to fear the yes within ourselves  our deepest cravings. ... The fear that we cannot grow beyond whatever distortions we may find within ourselves keeps us docile and loyal and obedient  externally defined  and leads us to accept many facets of our oppression...’ What are your deepest cravings for self-love? What distortions have you accepted as truths? Where do you need to resist how you have become docile  loyal  and obedient? What does it mean to pursue your own definition  your own LOVE?” . .

clean_eating,“At the same time that I was seeking to strengthen my connection to my Jewish culture and heritage  around the world there was a rise in antisemitism. People were hurt  even killed  for being Jewish. Others seemed to think nothing about spouting antisemitic hate  brandishing new forms of Nazi salutes  baring their hatred with pride.  Though most of those events were concentrated in Europe  for the first time in my life I felt scared of being Jewish.“  [image description: The photograph features a menorah sitting on a kitchen table  with three candles burning brightly as the others fade.]
