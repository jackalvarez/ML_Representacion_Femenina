We appreciate you and your hard work and big hearts so much! ❤️ Never stop fighting.   In 1815  Meachum’s  owner  took her to St. Louis  Missouri. Her husband followed and purchased her freedom shortly afterward. The Meachums ran a school for free and enslaved black people in the First African Baptist Church  which they later moved to a floating steamboat on the Mississippi River when the state of Missouri banned education for blacks in 1847. After the death of her husband in 1854  Meachum continued running their home on Fourth Street as a ‘safe house’ on the Underground Railroad. On May 21  1855  after an attempt to ferry nine enslaved people across the Mississippi River to freedom in Illinois  Meachum and a freedman named Isaac were arrested for breaking the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. On May 24  1854  she was charged in court with slave theft  while charges against Isaac were dropped.   https://blackthen.com/mary-meachum-abolitionist-helped-enslaved-escape-freedom/

However  judgements are judgements. There may be more acceptable judgements  or more taboo judgements. For example  it s more acceptable to say  oh wow you ve lost weight  good job!  and more taboo to say  you ve gained weight  what happened? . Just because one is more socially acceptable  doesn t mean the praised-based  positive judgement  serves the person. Whether it be praising or scolding  judgements create a hierarchical interaction. It is implied that the person doing the judging has more ability than the person being judged. If a person thrives off praise  praise will always be based on the values system of the person dishing it out. . . If you ve noticed someone s weight change - it is not your task to pass judgement on that - positive or negative. If you thrive off people commenting positively on your body  especially after weight or body related change  what are you really seeking from them? . . I understand this is a topic of debate. This is the angle I take. If this doesn t vibe with you  that s okay. May it be food for thought. . . #psychology #arttherapy #healthateverysize #stigma #mentalhealth #feminism #wellbeing #health #mentalillness #fatstigma #dietculture #selflove #gratitude #bodypositivity #bopo #bodyimage #counselling #therapy #mindfulness . . .

It’s important to think very carefully about what impact calling the police could have on someone. Thinking twice could save a life.  “One question to ask is  ‘How can I make this person or situation safer?’ With a mental health emergency  the immediate goal is not for the person to be 100% okay  but for them to get to a place where they can utilize other resources.”  [image description: person with dark hair.

We step forward and accept the love we deserve. Happy pride month family; be yourself  love yourself and take care of your temple (your body.)

We wanted to revisit some words from @thebodyisnotanapology around three keys to having good sex with non-binary people (even if it’s with yourself!): 1. Unlearn the binary scripts of sex: Your “gender identity is not necessarily directly correlated with what [you] like in bed  and [your] sexual experiences do not need to be informed by the gender binary.” 2. Recognize dysphoria: “The sounds you make  the expectations of what your body should do or should experience  the way you move – all this has been gendered  and whether you are nonbinary or being intimate with someone who is  it’s a process of consciously detaching those reductive gender ideas from what’s actually happening.  3. Focus on the realities of you and your bodies: “Remember that there’s no should here  nothing should necessarily feel good  just focus on what is...this is your body  and you are in control of what you do with it and what you want others to do with you. You define what feels pleasurable to you.

The family from El Salvador were trying escape extreme poverty and seek asylum in the US but they were turned away. They tried to cross the Rio Grande and only the mother   Tania Vanessa Ávalos made it out alive.  The family was surviving with $10 a day in El Salvador (the country still uses US dollar currency). Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez wanted to work in the US so he can raised money to build a home for his wife and daughters. My condolences to the family and the mother for their lost. 🌹 . . “From the scorching Sonoran Desert to the fast-moving Rio Grande  the 2 000-mile U.S.-Mexico border has long been an at times deadly crossing between ports of entry. A total of 283 migrant deaths were recorded last year; the toll so far this year has not been released (CNN).” . . Currently the internet and news are circulating a photo of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and Valeria found dead by the Rio Grande. If you look up the story this image will come up. . . If you choice to share the image of their death for shock value or to share your platform on immigration human rights. Please remember this was a family in search of a better life. Please be respectful and show compassion and empathy. Perhaps consider sharing a photo that humanizes them. This family like many others risk their lives sólo para buscar una vida mejor.  #restinpower . .

Thinking twice could save a life.  “One question to ask is  ‘How can I make this person or situation safer?’ With a mental health emergency  the immediate goal is not for the person to be 100% okay  but for them to get to a place where they can utilize other resources.”  [image description: person with dark hair.

This can be incredibly harmful to our mental state.

Starting new diets… Trying new workout programs… Constantly searching for the thing that will finally work for you…  Yes  even years into my own career as a coach I remember thinking to myself…  “Can’t nutrition and exercise just be easier?”  From the time I was a teenager  I tried nearly everything...low-fat  low-carb  six small meals a day  intermittent fasting  low calorie  carb cycling  keto  elimination diets  cheat days  and more.  I also spent countless grueling hours in the gym  pushing myself to the point of illness and injury.  All because I didn’t think I was:  Lean enough… Thin enough… Small enough… Pretty enough… Good enough…  And my relationship with food was no better.  My mind was consumed with what I was or wasn’t allowed to eat  and I always felt deprived  so I could never stick with any diet or meal plan very long.  Between the constant deprivation and the exhaustion from my workouts  I spent years on and off the diet and exercise roller coaster -- desperate for a way off.  Eventually I did find a way off  but it took nearly a decade  and every day I hear from women -- yes  even those who are health and fitness professionals themselves -- who are experiencing the same thing.  That’s why I’m so excited our team put together this FREE 5-Day Course:  → How to Step Off The Diet & Exercise Roller Coaster For Good  This FREE course is designed to teach you how to get the exact results you’re looking for -- without extreme dieting or crushing yourself in the gym.  In this 5-day course you’ll learn how to:  Ditch dieting for good and still get amazing results Exercise less and feel better than ever before Know exactly what to do in the gym (and what not to do) Stay consistent even if you re busy  injured  or unmotivated Learn simple  but important strategies for making your results last  ...and much more -- all from years of experience working with women.  xoxo  Molly   Want in?

Fit  women are  obsessed.   Fat  women are  lazy.   Skinny  women need to  eat a sandwich.   Muscular  women are  manly.   Curvy  women are  real women.   No one is immune to these labels and judgments as long as we continue to accept society s view that the value of a woman is in her decoration.  It s time we put an end to these labels and judgments.   To live in a world where women are regarded as people and not decoration  we need to stop making comments on other women’s appearance as though it is our right to do so. We’ll be doing each other a favor.  - Erin Brown  Further  while it s crucial to recognize that while body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  it s important to note that the impact/outcome/experiences of thin or straight-sized women cannot be conflated with those of women in larger bodies.  Anti-fatness  fat bias  and fat stigma are incredibly important issues that cannot be ignored as they affect the mental  physical  and emotional well-being of so many folks  from medical concerns being brushed off or incorrectly attributed to body size  to not being able to find clothes that fit  to consistent harassment  discrimination  and abuse related to body size.  While body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  the experiences and outcomes are absolutely not the same.

On my way home I was hungry  thirsty  and most of all -- CRANKY.  I walked in my house  dramatically flinging the door open for effect and -- BAM!  I smacked right into it.  Something was blocking the door so I couldn t fully open it. One of my biggest pet peeves.  UGH.  The story I told myself was Casey Sasek didn t care about me enough to make sure nothing was blocking the door when I got home  and worse -- he probably KNEW it was blocking the door and *really* didn t care.  I mean -- he KNEW I was on my way home.  It s clearly HIS fault I m so cranky.  I was ready to start a fight.  Then I stopped  took a deep breath  and asked myself:  Is this true or is it a story I m telling myself?  Do I really want to start a fight?  What s going on? What do I need right now?  It hit me.  All I needed was for him to recognize my crankiness and validate me.  Of course I m cranky. I spent five hours at the dentist. That sucks. Anyone would be cranky.  I walked into the room and pouted:  “I m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.   He got up  walked over  wrapped his arms tightly around me and said   “I m sorry  babe. That DOES suck. It sounds awful.   Instantly my whole body relaxed.  That was all I needed (plus some coffee and food!)  Later I wondered -- how different could things be if we actually ASKED for what we need?  Instead of blowing it up  starting a fight  lashing out  making our problem their problem.  What if we just asked for what we need in the moment?  I need attention. I need validation. I need you to tell me that it s going to be OK. I need you to tell me that I m going to be OK. I need you to be angry at what I m angry at. I need you to see me. I need you to hear me. I need you to love me.  Yes  this is easier said than done.  And I don t always know what I need in the moment  and that s OK.  But I ve found it gets better with practice.  When I m able to stop  get silent  and tune in -- allowing myself to be vulnerable enough to ask for what I need -- it s always a game-changer.  📸: Beaux Arts Photographie

Strength training is one of our favorite things  and we re thrilled to see so many women coming on board.  Women of all ages are discovering the true benefits of strength  and it’s beautiful! Strength looks different on everyone  and can even mean something different for different bodies and different goals.  No matter the goal  strength is gained through moving against resistance in some way (your own body weight counts).  And  the resistance must be “heavy” enough to sufficiently challenge the body to elicit any change in strength  performance  body composition or aesthetics.  But how do you determine what constitutes “heavy”? That answer can be very different  depending on who you ask  and Get Results Expert IronValkyrie Ingrid Marcum shares more here.

It’s not hard to see how disordered eating and mental health struggles can be associated with the fitness industry because of this.  Most of the articles in the top-selling fitness magazines play up insecurities  encouraging us to jump on every latest trend to change all the things we dislike about ourselves.  It’s all about how much we can take away from our body  and how tracking everything we eat and do is necessary for any kind of noticeable progress. Physical activity becomes another gateway to feed disordered eating habits.  - Christine Beauchamp  MANY of us associate morality with our diet and exercise: we re  good  when we re on plan and  ba   when we stray from it  and we re constantly playing ping pong between these two extremes. This can be incredibly harmful to our mental state.  Christine Beauchamp lets you know that if you re having a tough time in the fitness industry (whether you re a fitness professional or an enthusiast)  you re NOT alone.  She discusses how this can show up in our fitness pursuits  and offers solutions for protecting our mental health  in the face of the unattainable  perfection  society pushes on us.  Read more here!

When people say that they are “double jointed ” what they re referring to is joint hypermobility  which is the ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.  It isn’t uncommon for people to have a few hypermobile joints (like fingers  elbows  and knees)  and in most people this doesn’t cause any problems. However  some hypermobile people may experience more dislocations and sprains due to looseness of the stabilizing structures such as tendons  ligaments  and the joint capsule.
