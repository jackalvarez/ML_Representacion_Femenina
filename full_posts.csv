We appreciate you and your hard work and big hearts so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è Never stop fighting.   In 1815  Meachum‚Äôs  owner  took her to St. Louis  Missouri. Her husband followed and purchased her freedom shortly afterward. The Meachums ran a school for free and enslaved black people in the First African Baptist Church  which they later moved to a floating steamboat on the Mississippi River when the state of Missouri banned education for blacks in 1847. After the death of her husband in 1854  Meachum continued running their home on Fourth Street as a ‚Äòsafe house‚Äô on the Underground Railroad. On May 21  1855  after an attempt to ferry nine enslaved people across the Mississippi River to freedom in Illinois  Meachum and a freedman named Isaac were arrested for breaking the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. On May 24  1854  she was charged in court with slave theft  while charges against Isaac were dropped.   https://blackthen.com/mary-meachum-abolitionist-helped-enslaved-escape-freedom/

Fit  women are  obsessed.   Fat  women are  lazy.   Skinny  women need to  eat a sandwich.   Muscular  women are  manly.   Curvy  women are  real women.   No one is immune to these labels and judgments as long as we continue to accept society s view that the value of a woman is in her decoration.  It s time we put an end to these labels and judgments.   To live in a world where women are regarded as people and not decoration  we need to stop making comments on other women‚Äôs appearance as though it is our right to do so. We‚Äôll be doing each other a favor.  - Erin Brown  Further  while it s crucial to recognize that while body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  it s important to note that the impact/outcome/experiences of thin or straight-sized women cannot be conflated with those of women in larger bodies.  Anti-fatness  fat bias  and fat stigma are incredibly important issues that cannot be ignored as they affect the mental  physical  and emotional well-being of so many folks  from medical concerns being brushed off or incorrectly attributed to body size  to not being able to find clothes that fit  to consistent harassment  discrimination  and abuse related to body size.  While body shaming ANY body is bad for everybody  the experiences and outcomes are absolutely not the same.

I spent FIVE hours in the dentist chair yesterday.  On my way home I was hungry  thirsty  and most of all -- CRANKY.  I walked in my house  dramatically flinging the door open for effect and -- BAM!  I smacked right into it.  Something was blocking the door so I couldn t fully open it. One of my biggest pet peeves.  UGH.  The story I told myself was Casey Sasek didn t care about me enough to make sure nothing was blocking the door when I got home  and worse -- he probably KNEW it was blocking the door and *really* didn t care.  I mean -- he KNEW I was on my way home.  It s clearly HIS fault I m so cranky.  I was ready to start a fight.  Then I stopped  took a deep breath  and asked myself:  Is this true or is it a story I m telling myself?  Do I really want to start a fight?  What s going on? What do I need right now?  It hit me.  All I needed was for him to recognize my crankiness and validate me.  Of course I m cranky. I spent five hours at the dentist. That sucks. Anyone would be cranky.  I walked into the room and pouted:  ‚ÄúI m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.   He got up  walked over  wrapped his arms tightly around me and said   ‚ÄúI m sorry  babe. That DOES suck. It sounds awful.   Instantly my whole body relaxed.  That was all I needed (plus some coffee and food!)  Later I wondered -- how different could things be if we actually ASKED for what we need?  Instead of blowing it up  starting a fight  lashing out  making our problem their problem.  What if we just asked for what we need in the moment?  I need attention. I need validation. I need you to tell me that it s going to be OK. I need you to tell me that I m going to be OK. I need you to be angry at what I m angry at. I need you to see me. I need you to hear me. I need you to love me.  Yes  this is easier said than done.  And I don t always know what I need in the moment  and that s OK.  But I ve found it gets better with practice.  When I m able to stop  get silent  and tune in -- allowing myself to be vulnerable enough to ask for what I need -- it s always a game-changer.  üì∏: Beaux Arts Photographie

Check out the Band Deadlift  another awesome  lifting without a gym  gem from GGS owner  Molly Galbraith!  This band tension adds up QUICKLY  and these get hard. As the video shows  you step on one end of the band  making sure to give yourself some slack between your feet  and you wrap the other end of the band around your neck.   (There are two options for your arms  the second being the more  secure  option  but choose whichever is more comfortable)   You can play around with your foot position  but you ll likely need to be about shoulder-width apart or wider for your comfort  then you ll hinge back into your hips  and grab the band between your feet.  From there  you perform a regular Deadlift motion... - keeping your core nice and stiff -  bringing your hips  hard to stand up - maintaining a nice  neutral spine - keeping tension on your lats - squeezing your glutes at the top    ...then reversing the motion to get back into the start position.

However  judgements are judgements. There may be more acceptable judgements  or more taboo judgements. For example  it s more acceptable to say  oh wow you ve lost weight  good job!  and more taboo to say  you ve gained weight  what happened? . Just because one is more socially acceptable  doesn t mean the praised-based  positive judgement  serves the person. Whether it be praising or scolding  judgements create a hierarchical interaction. It is implied that the person doing the judging has more ability than the person being judged. If a person thrives off praise  praise will always be based on the values system of the person dishing it out. . . If you ve noticed someone s weight change - it is not your task to pass judgement on that - positive or negative. If you thrive off people commenting positively on your body  especially after weight or body related change  what are you really seeking from them? . . I understand this is a topic of debate.

But what the @apapsychiatric report goes on to clarify  and what is immensely helpful  is some of the underlying reason WHY this is the case. Put simply  ‚ÄúHealth disparities among LGBTQ people are linked to stigma and discrimination.‚Äù Meaning: feeling safe accessing healthcare services  lack of social support  familial rejection  higher rates of poverty and unemployment (among trans people in particular)  and violence are all factors leading to the more fragile state of LGBTQ mental health.  While this study is wildly helpful and affirming in its callout of these causes for mental health distress  it also implies the need for future research to understand the non-binary population for a more nuanced picture of the LGBTQ community as it evolves  particularly with the growing number of youth identifying as non-binary.  And so we (especially straight/cis allies  and people of privilege within the LGBTQ community) should be asking ourselves: how do we create a more inclusive world for people of all genders and sexualities?

This is something I tell myself when I am having a bad body day: you are modeling freedom to others. ‚Ä¢ I tell this story over and over again - I came to fat liberation through a Flickr stream of fat fashion babes 10 years ago. The fat liberation story almost always goes like this‚Äîthe visibility of fat & free women  witnessed by the fat and still fatphobic. It gives your brain this understanding of -oh- what if I didn‚Äôt focus my life on changing my body into something it has never been? What if I just...lived my life? Could I be happy like these women so clearly are? Could I stop weight cycling? Could I disengage from the agreement that there‚Äôs something inherently wrong or bad or immoral about my body?  They taught me how fat could be cool‚Äîhow historically  the marginalized groups  the outsiders  the early adopters  those outside the normative  ahead of the mainstream: they are always the driving force of cool  of art  of punk  of fashion  of innovation. Seeing women who were both fatter and cooler than me  modeling freedom  fundamentally changed my brain.

Unlearn the binary scripts of sex: Your ‚Äúgender identity is not necessarily directly correlated with what [you] like in bed  and [your] sexual experiences do not need to be informed by the gender binary.‚Äù 2. Recognize dysphoria: ‚ÄúThe sounds you make  the expectations of what your body should do or should experience  the way you move ‚Äì all this has been gendered  and whether you are nonbinary or being intimate with someone who is  it‚Äôs a process of consciously detaching those reductive gender ideas from what‚Äôs actually happening.  3. Focus on the realities of you and your bodies: ‚ÄúRemember that there‚Äôs no should here  nothing should necessarily feel good  just focus on what is...this is your body  and you are in control of what you do with it and what you want others to do with you.

She wanted us to share both her poem (her first ever! We are so honored) and the backstory behind it. We hope it resonates with you as you pursue your own journeys of radical self-love and healing! <3  (Content note: includes references to abuse  including childhood sexual abuse)   This Body of Mine...  By Jessica Bombra  This body of mine   Full of scars & imperfections.  It has felt pleasure. It has has felt pain. It has been loved. It has been abused. It has birthed children. It has nurtured. It has given pleasure. It has loved. It has comforted the dying. It has embraced in joy. It has mourned. It has celebrated.  It is perfectly imperfect   This body of mine.  --  Jessica s backstory:   I stumbled upon your book this summer in the airport in Omaha  NE of all places. I immediately picked it up  purchased it and read it. I just knew I had to. This past summer so many things happened in my life  I came to several realizations and this book played a huge role in those realizations. I grew up mostly in a single parent home with an addict mom (mostly alcohol but some drugs also)  had an addict father and step-father  had been molested as a small child and raped as a teen. I questioned my sexual identity for ages. Then grew up and chose men who have tried to change me and tell me I would be good if only...There‚Äôs always been something about me  about my body that wasn‚Äôt good enough for them. I started believing that at an early age. I‚Äôm nearly 50 now and am in a marriage that isn‚Äôt so great but I‚Äôm working on changing that. I‚Äôm working on taking care of myself and my children. I‚Äôm working on accepting and loving myself and taking charge of me. I‚Äôm also finally able to say  without doubt  that I identify as pan-sexual. I‚Äôm embracing my sexuality and becoming comfortable with who I am. So. Thank you. I‚Äôm so glad that I discovered your book. I‚Äôm so glad I discovered you.   Thank you so much  Jessica. <3
