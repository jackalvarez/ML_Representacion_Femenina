Talk about smashing down all those barriers 🙌 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/48071948,2019-05-08T12:07:11+0000,2188689924562178_2188814101216427,da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709,0,"Celebrating something that is oppressive to women in the modern age is not something to applaud. Women are dying and being jailed and abused for the fight against such control and oppression. Wake up.  ‪The hijab,burqa & niqab should be banned forever. They r not comparable with western or modern civilised tolerant societies They are exclusionary,misogynistic ,segregating & debilitating -I can’t even say they belong in the dark ages because they were only brought in the 70s‬  Think of a beautiful day... fresh light breeze.... warm sun... bright blue shy.... white fluffy cloudszzz and you are walking on the beach or across the fields.... sun on your face, wind through your hair and against your skin.... the warmth from the rays warming your skin....  Legs in shorts- t shirt flapping in the breeze- hair flowing.  How amazing that feels   Now think about that same beautiful day and imagine wearing a full blown niqab. Black. To the floor. Head and face and arms all covered. Just slits for your eyes. Still feel the glorious elements? Still feel exhilarated. Still free? Or just the hijab with your hair restricted the sun hot on your head- your neck hot.  .You feel burdened- heavy- restricted- suffocated- overwhelmed.   Or the feel of rain on your skin or the refreshing cool sea. Bs wearing a full blown wetsuit that feels damp and heavy and restrictive .  All the while your partner gets the freedom to choose whatever he wishes   Which would you choose.   Exactly  Imagine doing the commute in one Doing the groceries The school run  There is not one rational argument for this modern day slave chain   The fact that some argue for its existence and the “right” for women to “choose” this garment whilst others are tortured or murdered over it and how communities enslaved by Isis are when liberated throw off these garments and burn them- shows just how lost the world has become and how naively stupid and how we have gone too far the way of liberalism we can no longer see the truth right in front of us .  Follow brave heroic women like Yasmine Mohammed orMasih Alinejad. Then you will learn.",2019-05-08T13:47:01+0000,0,,
