We all work really hard to hide things that are shameful  and when it comes to being female  damn near everything is shameful.  - Jessi Kneeland  In this article  body image coach Jessi Kneeland shows us the shame we experience as women (and once you see it  you can t un-see it) AND what we can do about it in our daily lives.,2019-06-22T17:00:00+0000,2185094664901157_2234098436667446,da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709,0,Such a great read.

Check out the Band Deadlift  another awesome  lifting without a gym  gem from GGS owner  Molly Galbraith!  This band tension adds up QUICKLY  and these get hard. As the video shows  you step on one end of the band  making sure to give yourself some slack between your feet  and you wrap the other end of the band around your neck.   (There are two options for your arms  the second being the more  secure  option  but choose whichever is more comfortable)   You can play around with your foot position  but you ll likely need to be about shoulder-width apart or wider for your comfort  then you ll hinge back into your hips  and grab the band between your feet.  From there  you perform a regular Deadlift motion... - keeping your core nice and stiff -  bringing your hips  hard to stand up - maintaining a nice  neutral spine - keeping tension on your lats - squeezing your glutes at the top    ...then reversing the motion to get back into the start position.

Starting new diets… Trying new workout programs… Constantly searching for the thing that will finally work for you…  Yes  even years into my own career as a coach I remember thinking to myself…  “Can’t nutrition and exercise just be easier?”  From the time I was a teenager  I tried nearly everything...low-fat  low-carb  six small meals a day  intermittent fasting  low calorie  carb cycling  keto  elimination diets  cheat days  and more.  I also spent countless grueling hours in the gym  pushing myself to the point of illness and injury.  All because I didn’t think I was:  Lean enough… Thin enough… Small enough… Pretty enough… Good enough…  And my relationship with food was no better.  My mind was consumed with what I was or wasn’t allowed to eat  and I always felt deprived  so I could never stick with any diet or meal plan very long.  Between the constant deprivation and the exhaustion from my workouts  I spent years on and off the diet and exercise roller coaster -- desperate for a way off.  Eventually I did find a way off  but it took nearly a decade  and every day I hear from women -- yes  even those who are health and fitness professionals themselves -- who are experiencing the same thing.  That’s why I’m so excited our team put together this FREE 5-Day Course:  → How to Step Off The Diet & Exercise Roller Coaster For Good  This FREE course is designed to teach you how to get the exact results you’re looking for -- without extreme dieting or crushing yourself in the gym.  In this 5-day course you’ll learn how to:  Ditch dieting for good and still get amazing results Exercise less and feel better than ever before Know exactly what to do in the gym (and what not to do) Stay consistent even if you re busy  injured  or unmotivated Learn simple  but important strategies for making your results last  ...and much more -- all from years of experience working with women.  xoxo  Molly   Want in?

During pregnancy  these exercises help build lower body strength & support your pelvis and spine.  Remember to:  - Raise the hips up so you have a straight line from your knees to shoulders  by squeezing your glutes as tight as you can. - Lower the hips down towards the floor as you raise your upper body up  and return to the starting position. - Be careful not to hyper-extend your lower back in this position. Think about keeping your ribcage and your pelvis tucked towards one another the entire time.  Want more lower body exercises perfect for training in pregnancy?

This is one of the most common phrases we hear when women talk about wanting to change their body composition (read: lose body fat).  The problem with adding more and more cardio is that it has a point of diminishing returns.

In it, Jen says,  ""The kind of cardio I’m talking about is moderate-intensity, steady-state cardio, in which your heart rate is between 120 and 140 beats per minute throughout the duration of the activity.  Moderate-intensity cardio plays a key role in a well-rounded exercise program, offering a number of benefits. For starters, it helps develop your aerobic base, which is important for exercise performance. For example: if you have lifted weights in a fairly basic manner and become easily winded, it was probably because due to a poorly-developed aerobic base. Moderate intensity cardio can help with that. In addition, moderate-intensity cardio can improve your recovery, improve your sleep quality, and increase your body’s capacity to deal with stress. Lastly, cardio contributes to your overall energy expenditure, which can certainly be helpful if your goal is fat loss.  All of these are wonderful reasons to perform cardiovascular exercise, and at Girls Gone Strong, we generally encourage most women to integrate two 25- to 30-minute sessions of moderate-intensity cardio into their exercise routine per week, for optimal fat loss.  However, like many other things in life, more isn’t always better when it comes to cardio and fat loss. When you are using cardio as a tool for fat loss, there comes a point of diminishing returns when you do more than what is necessary to simply elicit the desired result.  For example, more exercise can increase your appetite and make you feel voraciously hungry. Additionally, the body perceives exercise as a form of stress and reacts to it the same way that it reacts to anything else that’s stressful. So while doing more exercise can feel good emotionally and make you feel like you’re taking action to address your stalled progress, stress is stress is stress—and cortisol will always respond accordingly.""  I hope this helps!",2019-05-28T12:22:34+0000,0,,

I’ve seen hundreds of men and women training like this and every one is lean. Not the most scientific observation, but cycling, more than running is very conducive to many hours a week of moderate training as there is no weight bearing or eccentric load so you’re never sore. I’ve also rarely seen high cortisol come as a result of such a huge cardio volume. Cyclists have huge appetites, are usually very lean, and are never sore. The flip side is their physiques don’t develop muscle very much, just a little in the legs. Still they look and feel great.",2019-05-28T12:56:15+0000,0,,

It’s not hard to see how disordered eating and mental health struggles can be associated with the fitness industry because of this.  Most of the articles in the top-selling fitness magazines play up insecurities  encouraging us to jump on every latest trend to change all the things we dislike about ourselves.  It’s all about how much we can take away from our body  and how tracking everything we eat and do is necessary for any kind of noticeable progress. Physical activity becomes another gateway to feed disordered eating habits.  - Christine Beauchamp  MANY of us associate morality with our diet and exercise: we re  good  when we re on plan and  ba   when we stray from it  and we re constantly playing ping pong between these two extremes.

On my way home I was hungry  thirsty  and most of all -- CRANKY.  I walked in my house  dramatically flinging the door open for effect and -- BAM!  I smacked right into it.  Something was blocking the door so I couldn t fully open it. One of my biggest pet peeves.  UGH.  The story I told myself was Casey Sasek didn t care about me enough to make sure nothing was blocking the door when I got home  and worse -- he probably KNEW it was blocking the door and *really* didn t care.  I mean -- he KNEW I was on my way home.  It s clearly HIS fault I m so cranky.  I was ready to start a fight.  Then I stopped  took a deep breath  and asked myself:  Is this true or is it a story I m telling myself?  Do I really want to start a fight?  What s going on? What do I need right now?  It hit me.  All I needed was for him to recognize my crankiness and validate me.  Of course I m cranky. I spent five hours at the dentist. That sucks. Anyone would be cranky.  I walked into the room and pouted:  “I m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.   He got up  walked over  wrapped his arms tightly around me and said   “I m sorry  babe. That DOES suck. It sounds awful.   Instantly my whole body relaxed.  That was all I needed (plus some coffee and food!)  Later I wondered -- how different could things be if we actually ASKED for what we need?  Instead of blowing it up  starting a fight  lashing out  making our problem their problem.  What if we just asked for what we need in the moment?  I need attention. I need validation. I need you to tell me that it s going to be OK. I need you to tell me that I m going to be OK. I need you to be angry at what I m angry at. I need you to see me. I need you to hear me. I need you to love me.  Yes  this is easier said than done.  And I don t always know what I need in the moment  and that s OK.  But I ve found it gets better with practice.

On my way home I was hungry  thirsty  and most of all -- CRANKY.  I walked in my house  dramatically flinging the door open for effect and -- BAM!  I smacked right into it.  Something was blocking the door so I couldn t fully open it. One of my biggest pet peeves.  UGH.  The story I told myself was Casey Sasek didn t care about me enough to make sure nothing was blocking the door when I got home  and worse -- he probably KNEW it was blocking the door and *really* didn t care.  I mean -- he KNEW I was on my way home.  It s clearly HIS fault I m so cranky.  I was ready to start a fight.  Then I stopped  took a deep breath  and asked myself:  Is this true or is it a story I m telling myself?  Do I really want to start a fight?  What s going on? What do I need right now?  It hit me.  All I needed was for him to recognize my crankiness and validate me.  Of course I m cranky. I spent five hours at the dentist. That sucks. Anyone would be cranky.  I walked into the room and pouted:  “I m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.

I walked into the room and pouted:  “I m hungry + thirsty + tired + cranky + I just spent 5 hours in the dentist chair and I just need you to tell me...THAT IT SUCKS.   He got up  walked over  wrapped his arms tightly around me and said   “I m sorry  babe. That DOES suck. It sounds awful.   Instantly my whole body relaxed.  That was all I needed (plus some coffee and food!)  Later I wondered -- how different could things be if we actually ASKED for what we need?  Instead of blowing it up  starting a fight  lashing out  making our problem their problem.  What if we just asked for what we need in the moment?  I need attention. I need validation. I need you to tell me that it s going to be OK. I need you to tell me that I m going to be OK. I need you to be angry at what I m angry at. I need you to see me. I need you to hear me. I need you to love me.  Yes  this is easier said than done.  And I don t always know what I need in the moment  and that s OK.  But I ve found it gets better with practice.  When I m able to stop  get silent  and tune in -- allowing myself to be vulnerable enough to ask for what I need -- it s always a game-changer.  📸: Beaux Arts Photographie,2019-05-22T01:26:57+0000,2173751196035504_2175447562532534,da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709,0,So much truth here,2019-05-23T01:06:22+0000,0,,
