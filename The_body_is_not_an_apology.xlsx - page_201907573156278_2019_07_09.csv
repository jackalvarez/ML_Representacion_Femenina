As an advocate for fat liberation, I feel there is strong oppression to big people living in food deserts and with an  inability to get to and/or afford fresh produce and other “healthy” foods to lose weight. I also agree with it in a vegetarian context.  I believe the mention of female cows is specifically about their milk and that their babies are taken away from them so that cow milk can be sold to humans.  I have equal compassion for both humans and animals - and I believe animals are voiceless and innocent. While the cruel and horrific way animals are slaughtered can be compared to some human crime, slaughter is done on a much larger scale.",2019-06-29T05:35:06+0000,1,,

Let us acknowledge our history  our flaws and  be cognizant of what we can do to better ourselves and make a better world for everyone in our communities.

Trans women may not have male privilege but most of them have the experience of having conciously lived as a male identifies person which grants them access to a different pool of bodily experience than cis women (please correct me if you think different, I'm writing from an outside perspective). This lead to very interesting discussions concerning the metoo-movement as a trans woman friend of mine called it non-emancipative in a conversatiom where it strenghtened the misogynistic narrative of two people who had very much acces to male privilege and used it on a regular basis to the detriment of women*. As the article concludes: nothings easy. But I would like to advocate more understanding between cis and trans women since all have unique experiences of two fundamentally different concepts of womanhood (in a bazillion different forms since every body is different). They should be employed to enhance our images of womanhood from many different perspectives, not tear each other down. But that may be preaching to the choir.

But what the @apapsychiatric report goes on to clarify  and what is immensely helpful  is some of the underlying reason WHY this is the case. Put simply  “Health disparities among LGBTQ people are linked to stigma and discrimination.” Meaning: feeling safe accessing healthcare services  lack of social support  familial rejection  higher rates of poverty and unemployment (among trans people in particular)  and violence are all factors leading to the more fragile state of LGBTQ mental health.  While this study is wildly helpful and affirming in its callout of these causes for mental health distress  it also implies the need for future research to understand the non-binary population for a more nuanced picture of the LGBTQ community as it evolves  particularly with the growing number of youth identifying as non-binary.  And so we (especially straight/cis allies  and people of privilege within the LGBTQ community) should be asking ourselves: how do we create a more inclusive world for people of all genders and sexualities?

However, the original post is specifically about, complimenting someone on weight loss. It might help to start with asking yourself what your intention is in wanting to talk about someone's size and weight? Who is initiating the topic?  Is it important to compliment weight loss and if it is, why? Most people I know are hyper aware (and often have distorted views) of their weight, size and other aspects of appearance and don't need it pointed out.   For what it's worth I choose not to comment on people's weight; I have had people say, 'I've lost ___ lbs' and they seem upset I didn't compliment them on it but those moments are few and far between. If they bring up the topic I simply ask how they feel about it.  This is what I practice.

And I'm a big believer in deep breathing as well. What's fantastic is that it works whether you think it's going to or not (so you can be skeptical all you want, and let biology do the rest! ;) ). Deep breathing automatically signals the parasympathetic nervous system to activate, which moves you out of the reactive flight/fight mode (the sympathetic nervous system) into more of observative mode/relaxation response.

I am Sonya Renee Taylor, founder and radical executive officer of The Body is not an apology and I want to tell you about The Body is Not An Apology's radical self-love 10 Tools Intensive. This four-module e-course is really designed to move us out of the system of body shame and indoctrination into body terrorism and move us into a living daily practice of radical self-love.   The whole world is talking about radical self-love now. I've only been talking about it for the last nine years. [laughs] And so much so that I decided to create an entire organization dedicated to how we teach people to live in radical self-love, particularly as a tool for personal transformation and for social change. And this 10 Tools Intensive builds on the ten tools for radical self-love that The Body is Not An Apology developed years ago. It also lives in The Body is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love book, as part of our radical self-love toolkit.   So, we've been talking about these tools and we've been talking about radical self-love for a long time, so much so that it's the buzz word now. But here's what I know: talking about radical self-love is different than living it. And when we're really living into radical self-love, it transforms the way that we see the world. It transforms the way that we see our own bodies. And it transforms the systems and structures that thrive off of our disconnection and shame. It is an opportunity to have a new life, to have a new relationship with your body.  [00:01:49] 10 Tools Intensive guides you in really practical and simple ways through what we call at The Body is Not An Apology the Thinking, Doing, Being process. We believe that living in radical self-love -- which is our inherent state; you arrived here as radical self-love -- and really the disconnection between being radical self-love and not being radical self-love is really about the messages that the world has given us, that has been stacked and stacked and stacked on top of our inherent sense of worth, value, and divine enoughness.   And so in order to get back to that core of us, which is radical self-love, we've got to start stripping off those layers of body shame and body terrorism that we've been given over the years. That is the Thinking, Doing, Being process. It requires us to begin to think about the ways in which that indoctrination lives in us. To begin to act in contrary to that indoctrination, which then gives us access to a whole new way of being, which is actually who we inherently have always been: radical self-love.   So this course walks you through four modules. I lead in lectures. I share radical reflections, radical readings, and then power practices, these daily activities that are going to help you build your radical self-love muscle. All of this over the course of four modules that you can take at a time and pace that works for you and your life.   I hope that you will register. I hope that you will take this journey with us. I hope that you believe you deserve it, because I believe you deserve to live in deep and powerful radical self-love. Let's do the work together to get there.",2019-05-08T21:13:52+0000,1,,

But Robin has a good point as well. Neither of those people are what I would consider ""of size."" Just because our fatphobic culture wants us to define ""of size"" as anyone higher than the lowest end of the ""average"" range doesn't mean we should take the bait. I'm guessing that person is within, or very close to, the ""average"" range for her height. She just may not be in the lower weight range or have a body proportioned in a way that is considered the most desirable.  But using images like this and labeling this person ""of size"" only helps to make fat people more invisible. It tells people that the supposed ""fat"" acceptance movement is really about smaller bodied people who are only slightly larger than is considered acceptable, making it useless to those of us who face the harshest forms of discrimination and disenfranchisement.  https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/super-fat-erasure-how-smaller-fat-bodies-crowd-the-conversation/",2019-05-07T17:12:29+0000,8,,

Thank you for your instructive feedback. We realized that the original photo got cropped and so the full visuals of the two people’s bodies are more unclear. We referred to the person on the right as of size while recognizing that the majority of US women are of size and that “of size” is also a neutral term to describe a statistically common body. We agree that neither of these individuals fall under the category of superfat or infinifat and that the category “of size” covers a spectrum of bodies. Also, yes, it is our practice to use gender neutral descriptors when we don’t know how the individuals pictured identify, as well as descriptions of skin color versus racial categories when we don’t quite know that either.

That is not up for debate. What I meant is that ""white"" isn't an ethnic identity that can be defined by genetic testing, much less by looking at someone's skin. The definition of it has evolved over time, according to what those with power wanted it to mean, and who is considered white has changed over time. It is not an absolute thing, but merely a constantly changing social construct meant to express and maintain power. Recognizing and challenging white supremacy should not be the same thing as validating the belief that ""white"" is a thing that somehow makes those of us considered white somehow better, smarter, or in any way superior. We're just a different shade of human.  And though I understand your point, I still disagree with calling light skinned people with an unknown ethnic identity ""white presenting"" as they may not be trying to present as white even if they are being assumed to be white by others. Avoiding calling unknown people ""white"" isn't in deference to white people's feelings, but in deference to the feelings of PoC who may be mistaken for white and the ways that erases their ethnic and/or cultural identities.",2019-05-08T16:31:58+0000,0,,

Respecting body autonomy, respecting where people are in their awareness/analysis of weight stigma/humility for how I keep learning from people - all of that makes me wary of focusing so much on those individual decisions. But I don’t think that means we stop critiquing the prescription of weight loss for all its harms.",2019-05-02T17:45:23+0000,0,,

I think since the article is about reasons to exercise not about an individual's body autonomy that I was confused by your message intent.

""...self love is just as valid a reason as weight loss""? I was surprised to this piece here. Seems like it is pretty uncritical of the way fitness culture is a vector for healthism, and also assumes a certain degree of class privilege (eg, to ""reward oneself""). Can't we support other people's body autonomy to pursue weight loss or not without granting broad legitimacy to the idea of pursuing weight loss itself?  Those are two different things.",2019-05-01T17:30:20+0000,7,,
